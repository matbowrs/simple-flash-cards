# simple-flash-cards
Simple flash card management application.

# Purpose
This is my first Python GUI program. The purpose of the program
is for it to function similarly to using flashcards. 

# Running
The user will run the program using the following command in the 
command line: python3 FlashCardsGUI.py . 

The user will then
enter a word and definition (or any other combination of pairs,
such as capitals and countries, etc.). After entering the pairs,
there will be a small quiz on the pairs. 


Later functions include being able to see which pairs have been 
typed and an after-quiz function that shows what you got right
and wrong.
